# Brazil_microcepahly_analysis_public

Overview:
Contains the final code used in the analysis of Zika and microcephaly data from Brazil 2015-17 in the accompanying paper

Specifics:
TS_compiler.R
-	Compiles raw arbovirus testing data into timeseries for each municiaplity

Ind_micro_df_assembler_V5.R
-	Assembles datas from the raw databases into a standardised template used for all analyses

resp_sinasc_matcher_algo.R
- Implements a matching algorithm to link records in RESP to records in SINASC

Data checking.R
-	Checks the standard data generated by “Ind_micro_df_assembler_V5.R” for implausible values, performs data transformations and splits the data into different datasets for different analyses.

Data_selection_graphs.R
- Plots graphs comparing characteristics in the raw data with the summaray and full exposure history datasets

HT_server.R
- Fits the hypothesis testing models in parralell

HT_table.R
-	Takes the models fit in "HT_server.R" and builds a relative risk table

Mc_baseline.R
-	Calculates the baseline rate of microcephaly across Brazil

Mc_map.R
-	Maps observed rates of microcephaly

Zika_map.R
-	Maps predicted Zika cases given observed microcephaly and quantified Zika-microcephaly link

Out_table.R
-	Tests for an association between Zika and major categories of birth defects

NTD_BD_detailed.R
-	Tests for an association between Zika and specific high incidence birth defects

RR plots.R
-	Produces relative risk plots from the outcome of the hypothesis testing and other birth defect experiments 

Preg_expo_time.R
-	Conducts the analysis on which periods of pregnancy ZIKV infection confers the greatest risk

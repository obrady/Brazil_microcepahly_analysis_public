# Brazil_microcepahly_analysis_public

Overview:
Contains the final code used in the analysis of Zika and microcephaly data from Brazil 2015-17 in the accompanying paper

Specifics:
TS_compiler.R
-	Compiles raw arbovirus testing data into timeseries for each municiaplity

Ind_micro_df_assembler_V4.R
-	Assembles datas from the raw databases into a standardised template used for all analyses

Data checking.R
-	Checks the standard data generated by “Ind_micro_df_assembler_V4.R” for implausible values, performs data transformations and splits the data into different datasets for different analyses.

HT_table.R
-	Performs the hypothesis testing analysis (Figure 2 in the main manscript

Mc_baseline.R
-	Calculates the baseline rate of microcephaly across Brazil

Mc_map.R
-	Maps observed rates of microcephaly

Zika_map.R
-	Maps predicted Zika cases given observed microcephaly and quantified Zika-microcephaly link

Out_table.R
-	Tests for an association between Zika and major categories of birth defects

NTD_BD_detailed.R
-	Tests for an association between Zika and specific high incidence birth defects

RR plots.R
-	Produces relative risk plots from the outcome of the hypothesis testing and other birth defect experiments 

Preg_expo_time.R
-	Conducts the analysis on which periods of pregnancy ZIKV infection confers the greatest risk
